00:30:06,678 --> 00:30:10,264
And the middle school that's two and
a half hours away by bus and train.

313
00:30:10,265 --> 00:30:11,849
And that's just one way!

314
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:15,850
Don't get me wrong it's a wonderful
environment for raising children, but-

315
00:30:17,189 --> 00:30:20,189
where ever you're coming from
is way more convenient.

316
00:30:34,122 --> 00:30:36,290
Wow...

317
00:30:36,291 --> 00:30:38,334
It's so big...

318
00:30:38,335 --> 00:30:40,970
They're renting it out for a song.

319
00:30:40,971 --> 00:30:43,839
You'll be on the hook for repair costs.
And it needs a lot of work.

320
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:48,135
You can leave your shoes on.
This place has been abandoned for years.

321
00:30:48,136 --> 00:30:51,639
Let's not kid ourselves, it's ugly as sin.

322
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,310
But believe it or not, the wiring is still good
and it gets water from the stream.

323
00:30:56,311 --> 00:30:58,187
I'll even throw in all the stuff in the tool shed.

324
00:30:58,188 --> 00:31:00,064
Does the land include that field?

325
00:31:00,065 --> 00:31:02,984
Yeah, but I wouldn't go buying a
scarecrow just yet.

326
00:31:02,985 --> 00:31:06,112
Unfortunately, it's not viable as farm land.

327
00:31:06,113 --> 00:31:09,240
Animals come down from the mountain
and eat everything.

328
00:31:09,241 --> 00:31:13,536
They sorta pushed folks out.
In most places, it's the other way around.

329
00:31:13,537 --> 00:31:15,329
And are there any neighbors?

330
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:19,330
Well only if you use the term loosely,
there's no one around for miles.

331
00:31:20,078 --> 00:31:23,671
So, on to the next?
There's a cute little house in the village I think you'll -

332
00:31:23,672 --> 00:31:24,588
I'll take it.

333

334
00:31:25,632 --> 00:31:27,051

You should plant them nice

- You forgot to water the hole!
The soil's not going to be moist enough.

605

- Yeah it is. You can water them all you like
after you've planted them in the ground.

606

- Not if you want 'em to grow!

607
00:47:28,844 --> 00:47:31,221
Then you sprinkle a real thin
layer of fertilizer over it,

608

but don't over do it
or you'll get bugs.

grow worth a darn.

you want to grow anything!

Welcome to Niikawa Nature Sanctuary.
I'm Tendo.

One of the conservationists on staff.

837
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:32,937
Good morning Mr. Tendo!

838
01:01:32,938 --> 01:01:37,608
There's more to a nature conservationist's
than most people would think.

839
01:01:37,609 --> 01:01:41,403
Doing outreach with the kids, like today...
Conducting field surveys,

840
01:01:41,404 --> 01:01:45,991
rehabbing the flora and  fauna, as needed,
and coordinating with the volunteers.

841
01:01:45,992 --> 01:01:49,578
We wear a lot of different hats
at the sanctuary.

842
01:01:49,579 --> 01:01:52,623
We have to be Jacks of all trades,
and specialists at the same time.

843
01:01:52,624 --> 01:01:55,624
Look... We could use an assistant,
if that weren't the case,

844
01:01:55,625 --> 01:01:59,624
we wouldn't have posted that job notice.
I'd be more than happy to bring you on.

845
01:01:59,923 --> 01:02:03,923
Honestly, we keep this place going
on a shoe string budget. That said...

846
01:02:04,004 --> 01:02:08,180
We can cover your training expenses, if
you decide to become a conservationist,

847
01:02:08,181 --> 01:02:10,599
but that amount isn't very much at all...
<font color="#F0DC82">[ music fades ]</font>

848
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:14,186
A high schooler with a part-time job
would make more than you would here.

849
01:02:14,187 --> 01:02:16,188
Knowing all of that...

850
01:02:16,189 --> 01:02:18,441
...do you still want it?

851
01:02:19,442 --> 01:02:24,039
I heard, that you're caring for a wolf
here at the santuary...

852
01:02:27,242 --> 01:02:29,326
This is our timber wolf.

853
01:02:29,327 --> 01:02:30,953
- He's very quiet.

854
01:02:30,954 --> 01:02:33,497
Well, he's older now...

855
01:02:33,498 --> 01:02:35,583
- <i>Excuse me, Director?</i>

856
01:02:35,584 --> 01:02:40,584
Pardon me a moment.

857
01:02:45,176 --> 01:02:49,054
Nice to meet you. I'd like to ask
something if I may.

858
01:02:49,055 --> 01:02:51,056
My little boy here is a wolf child,

859
01:02:51,057 --> 01:02:53,142
but then the wolf who was
his father passed away.

860
01:02:53,143 --> 01:02:55,229
I'm a good mother,
but when it comes to raising wolf children,

861
01:02:55,230 --> 01:02:57,229
I'm kind of in the dark here...

862
01:02:57,230 --> 01:03:02,230
When you were learning to be a wolf,
what did they teach you?

863
01:03:03,403 --> 01:03:08,403
Please tell us how you were raised in the woods.
I want him to know that half of himself.

864
01:03:20,086 --> 01:03:22,380
Sorry about that.

865
01:03:23,381 --> 01:03:27,217
He was a pet... Guess his owner was
wealthy enough to bend the rules.

866
01:03:27,218 --> 01:03:30,638
but when ever he died,
nobody else would take the wolf in...

867
01:03:30,639 --> 01:03:33,933
If I remember it right,
he was born in the Moscow Zoo.

868
01:03:33,934 --> 01:03:35,935
So he isn't from the wild?

869
01:03:35,936 --> 01:03:38,979
I don't think I've ever heard of a zoo
taking in ferral wolf before.

870
01:03:38,980 --> 01:03:42,608
Zoo wolves are usually born in captivity.

871
01:03:42,609 --> 01:03:45,988
This old fellow isn't our only tenant,
we also take in injured birds and raccoon dogs.

872
01:03:46,089 --> 01:03:49,489
As soon as they're healed up,
we release them back into their natural habitat.

873
01:03:52,661 --> 01:03:54,995
I'm going to go to that place a lot from now on.

874
01:03:54,996 --> 01:03:57,124
You'll be okay with coming with me, won't you?

875
01:03:59,125 --> 01:04:02,169
I'm gonna learn all of the things
about nature that I can,

876
01:04:02,170 --> 01:04:05,215
and then we'll go home
and I'll teach it all to you.

877
01:04:06,216 --> 01:04:08,384
I've never seen one before...

878
01:04:08,385 --> 01:04:09,885
A wolf?

879
01:04:09,886 --> 01:04:11,887
So did Daddy act like that one?

880
01:04:11,888 --> 01:04:13,889
Not at all.

881
01:04:13,890 --> 01:04:14,932
Good, I'm glad.

882
01:04:14,933 --> 01:04:16,558
Why is that?

883
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:21,559
The one we saw today,
his eyes were kind of sad.

884
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:27,440
I wanted to meet a wolf like Daddy...

885
01:04:27,696 --> 01:04:31,991

No, you didn't.

because I'm the new kid?

The school's insurance
will cover any medical bills you have, so-

01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:07,400
Do you really think I'll let you
push this aside with a weak little apology?!

if my son looses his hearing in that ear?

I'm holding you responsible for this.

I will take you to court for everything you've got!

- Stop jumping to her defence!
My child is the one with the injury here!

A wolf.

1024

It was a wolf that did it.

1025
01:12:29,552 --> 01:12:31,178
It wasn't her, so lay off.

1030
01:12:38,019 --> 01:12:39,728
- Why would Yuki hurt him?

1031
01:12:39,729 --> 01:12:41,729
- I know he had a bandage on his head.

1032
01:12:42,273 --> 01:12:43,773
- For real?

1033
01:12:58,539 --> 01:13:00,540
What happened to Sohei,  Mr Tanabe?

1034
01:13:00,541 --> 01:13:01,917
He went home early.

1035
01:13:01,918 --> 01:13:03,210
Why'd he do that?

1036
01:13:03,211 --> 01:13:04,461
Because he got hurt.

1037
01:13:04,462 --> 01:13:06,338
Yeah but, how did Sohei get hurt?

1038
01:13:06,339 --> 01:13:07,339
I'd rather not-

1039
01:13:07,340 --> 01:13:09,382

you said in the principal's office, that a wolf did it.

just for like a split second.

1071
01:16:13,818 --> 01:16:18,818
and when I woke up, my ear was all bloody.
The wolf was the one who hurt me, it wasn't Yuki.

It's no fair she got in trouble 'cause of it.

she did it, but they weren't even there.

He isn't... a big fan of school.

Who ever it is,
I think they must be up there...

everyone is down here tending field.

- When it comes to the mountain...
Sensei knows everything.

1115
01:18:31,038 --> 01:18:33,039
He's been up there a long time.

1116

- I'm surprised you get along with
somebody so much older.

1117
01:18:36,418 --> 01:18:40,547
You should bring him home to visit Ame...
Sounds like quite a guy... I'd love to meet him.

1118
01:18:40,548 --> 01:18:42,549
Sensei's not much for people.

1119
01:18:42,550 --> 01:18:47,303
Unlike the other animals,
he doesn't come down here often.

1120
01:18:47,304 --> 01:18:52,304
Then again, he'd probably be okay with you.

1121
01:19:06,532 --> 01:19:09,532
That's him.
This entire mountain is his domain.

and how to find water,

Why isn't Mommy here yet?

1310
01:33:33,022 --> 01:33:34,440
Try not to worry.

1311
01:33:34,441 --> 01:33:36,024
But, I'm scared.

1312
01:33:36,025 --> 01:33:38,402
Come on, getting stuck in school
till tomorrow could be fun.

1313
01:33:38,403 --> 01:33:40,028
I mean, we could play cards all night.

1314
01:33:40,029 --> 01:33:41,113
Oh, really?

1315
01:33:41,114 --> 01:33:42,448
I wanna play.

1316
01:33:42,449 --> 01:33:44,032
Yeah, that sounds like fun!

1317
01:33:44,033 --> 01:33:45,534
A sleep over!

1318
01:33:45,535 --> 01:33:46,552
I'll go get the cards
from the classroom.

1319
01:33:46,553 --> 01:33:47,587
Okay?

1320
01:33:48,288 --> 01:33:50,289
What card games do you play?

1321
01:33:50,290 --> 01:33:52,082
Well I know Old Maid, but that's it.

1322
01:33:52,083 --> 01:33:53,167
That's boring!

1323
01:33:53,168 --> 01:33:55,628
Hey, don't be a brat!

1324
01:33:56,629 --> 01:33:58,380
Shino! Are you in here?

1325
01:33:58,381 --> 01:33:59,882
Oh, it's about time!

1326
01:33:59,883 --> 01:34:01,508
What took you so long?

1327
01:34:01,509 --> 01:34:04,001
I know. But, this weather is 
tough to drive in.

1328
01:34:04,002 --> 01:34:06,809
Hey, you want us to drop you off
on the way, Yuki?

1329
01:34:07,098 --> 01:34:09,558
Hmn? Good call... Come on,
grab your backpack.

1330
01:34:09,559 --> 01:34:11,268
- Uh... Actually...

1331
01:34:11,269 --> 01:34:13,187
What you waiting for?

1332
01:34:13,188 --> 01:34:17,274
Thanks for the offer, but I'm pretty sure 
my mom's gonna be here soon.

1333
01:34:17,275 --> 01:34:18,901
- Really, it's no trouble.

1334
01:34:18,902 --> 01:34:20,360
- Yeah silly.

1335
01:34:20,361 --> 01:34:23,071
I don't want my mom to
come all this way for nothing.

1336
01:34:23,072 --> 01:34:26,158
That's a good point.
Well, we're off, then.

1337
01:34:26,159 --> 01:34:27,284

1338
01:34:27,285 --> 01:34:27,785

Oh you're leaving?

1346
01:35:32,517 --> 01:35:35,686
Oh, did Yuki's mommy pick her up?

1347
01:35:35,687 --> 01:35:38,105
- The few of you left listen up!

1348
01:35:38,106 --> 01:35:40,101
Anybody who's still waiting,
come on over here.

1349
01:35:40,102 --> 01:35:43,106
We'll drive you home
in the school van, okay!

Why'd you come here?

1361
01:37:59,706 --> 01:38:02,165
Well, because...

1362
01:38:02,166 --> 01:38:04,001
...you disappeared.

1363
01:38:04,002 --> 01:38:07,713
They're gone.
Did they all get picked up?

1364
01:38:07,714 --> 01:38:11,466
It looks like even the teachers ditched us.

1365
01:38:11,467 --> 01:38:15,263
I just hope my mom's okay out there.

1366

It's chilly.

1367
01:38:17,181 --> 01:38:21,518
Come on then.

1368
01:38:21,519 --> 01:38:22,477
- Yuki.

Oh, I'm coming!

What happens if no one
comes to get us?

1371
01:38:29,485 --> 01:38:31,153
I guess we'll live at school.

1372
01:38:31,154 --> 01:38:32,654
But, where do we sleep.

1373
01:38:32,655 --> 01:38:34,865
They got some beds
in the nurse's office.

1374
01:38:34,866 --> 01:38:36,033
And what about food?

1375
01:38:36,034 --> 01:38:38,035
We'll scrounge in the lunch room.

1376
01:38:38,036 --> 01:38:41,371
What they never comes back?
We just live here forever?

1377
01:38:41,372 --> 01:38:44,458
I'll get a job.
Delivering papers or something.

1378
01:38:44,459 --> 01:38:47,127
You're just a kid.
Who's going to hire you?

1379
01:38:47,128 --> 01:38:50,338
No problem. I'll just lie
about how old I am.

1380
01:38:50,339 --> 01:38:54,339
I can pass as a
middle school, right?

1381
01:38:56,137 --> 01:38:57,054
No way.

1382
01:38:57,055 --> 01:38:57,555
Are you sure?

1383
01:39:02,143 --> 01:39:07,143
I tired of feeling like a kid.

1384
01:39:08,316 --> 01:39:08,816

1385
01:40:32,400 --> 01:40:33,900

1391

He's gone.

1392
01:41:31,125 --> 01:41:36,125
My heart was beating so fast.
Hey, what were we hiding for?

1393
01:41:37,256 --> 01:41:37,756
Hey!

1394
01:41:48,142 --> 01:41:50,185
It's like an ocean.

1395
01:41:50,186 --> 01:41:53,355

1396
01:41:53,356 --> 01:41:57,442
Sohei, were you serious
about us  living here?

1397
01:41:57,443 --> 01:41:59,736
If nobody shows up, we gotta.

1398
01:41:59,737 --> 01:42:03,365
They will.  I'll betcha your mom's
on the way right now.

1399
01:42:03,366 --> 01:42:04,658
As if.

1400
01:42:04,659 --> 01:42:06,659
Why wouldn't she be?

1401
01:42:10,289 --> 01:42:13,541
You know why.
She got married again.

1402
01:42:13,542 --> 01:42:15,567
And she's having a baby with him.

1403
01:42:15,568 --> 01:42:18,542
Once it gets here, she's
not gonna need me.

1404
01:42:21,676 --> 01:42:25,053
But when your ear got hurt,
she was so worried about you...

1405
01:42:25,054 --> 01:42:27,472
Don't get me wrong.
It's not like I care.

1406
01:42:27,473 --> 01:42:31,601
I'll just run away from home.
I'll go be a wrestler or a boxer.

1407
01:42:31,602 --> 01:42:33,812
Live my life like a lone wolf.

1408
01:42:33,813 --> 01:42:37,399
So what do you think?

1409
01:42:37,400 --> 01:42:39,526
You don't have a muscle on you, Sohei.

1410
01:42:39,527 --> 01:42:41,278
You'll be out in a second.

1411
01:42:41,279 --> 01:42:42,320
I'll train.

1412
01:42:42,321 --> 01:42:47,321
Non-stop, cause I'm alone.

1413
01:42:56,419 --> 01:43:00,964
I wish I... I wish I could tell people the truth.

1414
01:43:00,965 --> 01:43:05,965
and be fearless about it,
and smile like it doesn't even terrify me.

1415
01:43:19,817 --> 01:43:21,735
Sohei...

1416
01:43:21,736 --> 01:43:23,028
That day when...

1417
01:43:23,029 --> 01:43:28,029
the wolf that appeared out of nowhere
and clawed up your ear...

1418
01:43:31,078 --> 01:43:36,078
It was me.

1419
01:43:36,667 --> 01:43:41,667
I wanted to tell you for so long now.

1420
01:43:42,715 --> 01:43:47,715
I couldn't not tell you anymore.

1421
01:43:49,138 --> 01:43:52,766
All this time. I knew.

1422
01:43:52,767 --> 01:43:57,645
Don't be afraid.
I never told anyone.

1423
01:43:57,646 --> 01:44:01,483
And I'm never gonna... Your safe.

1424
01:44:01,484 --> 01:44:06,484
No more crying.

1425
01:44:07,823 --> 01:44:12,823
